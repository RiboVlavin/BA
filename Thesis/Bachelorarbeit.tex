% Copy this file as a template for your thesis. You will have to take
% action at all places marked by

% !!! Your action is needed here !!!
% !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
%
% The first place your action is needed is the first line of this
% document:
%
%
% Language of the thesis:
%
% You must use either 'german' or 'english' above, depending on the
% language used in the main text. This will automatically setup a lot
% of things in the background.
%
%
% Version of the class:
%
% You must specify which version of the thesis class is to be
% used. This is important in case the class style changes in later
% years, but we still want an older thesis to look the same, even when
% things are changed in the class.
%
% Do not change or remove the version-xxxx key.
%
%
% Text encoding:
%
% Your thesis *must* be encoded in utf8 (unicode), which is the
% default in most editors these days. Do *not* change this to latin8.



%%%
%
% Main setup:
%
%%%
%
% You must use the \UzLThesisSetup command to specify numerous things
% about your thesis. This includes the entries on the title page, the 
% abstracts, and the bibliography style. You do so by specifying
% so-called "values" for so-called "keys". For instance, 
% for the key "Autor" you must provide your name as the value. You do
% so by writing 'Autor = {Max Mustermann}', that is, the value is put
% into curly braces. You can use the \UzLThesisSetup command
% repeatedly and the order in which you provide the keys is not
% important. 
%
% Everything shown on the title page must be in German -- even
% if the thesis is written in English! Just insert German text for
% German keys and English text for English keys (like 'Abstract' needs
% English text, while 'Zusammenfassung' needs German text).

\UzLThesisSetup{

  % !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  %
  % First, specify the institut or clinic at which the thesis was
  % written. You get the logo file from them (make sure it has the
  % correct size, namely the same as the example). If they do not have
  % a logo, the university's default logo is used.
  %
  % The 'verfasst' gets two arguments. Change the first to {an der}
  % for clinics, as in 'Verfasst = {an der}{Medizinischen Klinik I}'
  %
  Logo-Dateiname        = {uzl-thesis-logo-uzl.pdf},
  Verfasst              = {am}{Institut f\"ur Neuro- und Bioinformatik},
  %
  % The titles:
  %
  Titel auf Deutsch     = {
    Analyse einer DNA-Datenbank auf Mutationsstabilit\"at basierend auf (bio-)chemisch relevanter Molek\"uleigenschaften
  }, 
  Titel auf Englisch    = {
    Analysis of a DNA Database for Mutation Stability Based on (Bio-)Chemically Relevant Molecular Properties 
  },
  %
  % Author and supervisor:
  % 
  % Note that the 'Betreuer' or 'Betreuerin' is the supervisor, that
  % is, the professor who officially supervises the thesis. If there
  % is also an assistent of the professor who helped (typically a
  % lot), use 'Mit Unterstützung von' to thank that person. If the
  % thesis was mainly written 'externally' at some company or another
  % institute, point this out using 'Weitere Unterstützung'. 
  % 
  % For your own name, do *not* add things like "BSc" or "BSc
  % cand.". For the supervisor, you should normally include
  % "Prof. Dr." or "PD Dr." (ask your supervisor, what is
  % appropriate), but nothing more (so no
  % "Univ.-Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult." unless your supervisor insists).  
  %
  Autor                 = {Leonie Nie\ss{}},
  Betreuerin            = {PD Dr. Amir Madany Mamlouk},
  % 
  % Optional: Supporting persons and institutions. The text should be
  % in German, even for an English thesis.
  %
  Mit Unterstützung von = {BSc. Nina Eichler},
  % 
  %   Weitere Unterstützung = {
  %     Die Arbeit ist im Rahmen einer Tätigkeit bei der Firma Muster GmbH
  %     entstanden.
  %   },
  %
  %
  % Your Degree Programm (Studiengang)
  %
  % Specify 'Bachelorarbeit' or 'Masterarbeit' and the degree
  % programme. Make sure the name of programme is correct and not
  % some abbreviation or some incorrect variant. For instance:
  % 'Medizinische Ingenierwissenschaft', but not 'MIW';
  % 'Medizinische Informatik', but not 'Medizin-Informatik';
  % 'Informatik', but not 'Informatik (SSE)'.
  %
  % Use German names for German programmes and English names for
  % English ones, so 'Infection Biology', not 'Infektionsbiologie'. 
  % For programmes that have a German bachelor and an English master,
  % use the German name for a bachelor thesis and the English name for
  % the master thesis.
  %
  Bachelorarbeit,
  Studiengang           = {Medizinische Informatik},
  %
  % Date on which the thesis is turned in German, formatted the
  % traditional German way:
  %
  Datum                 = \today,
  %
  % The English abstract. You must always provide abstracts in German
  % and in English. 
  %
  Abstract              = {
  
  },
  Zusammenfassung       = {
  
  },
  %
  % Optional: 'Danksagungen' (German) or 'Acknowledgements'
  % (English). Both keys are optional and both have the same effect of
  % adding an acknowledgements text after the abstracts and before the
  % table of contents.
  %
  %Acknowledgements      = {
  %  This is the place where you can thank people and institutions, do not try to do this on the title page. The only exception is in case you wrote your thesis while working or staying at a company or abroad. Then you should use the \Latex{Weitere Unterstützung} key to provide a text (in German) that acknowledges the company or foreign institute. For instance, you could use texts like »Die Arbeit ist im Rahmen einer Tätigkeit bei der Firma Muster GmbH entstanden« or »Die Arbeit ist im Rahmen eines Forschungsaufenthalts beim Institut für Dieses und Jenes an der Universität Entenhausen entstanden«. Do not name and thank individual persons from the company or foreign institute on the title page, do that here.

  % Bibliography style: Choose between
  % 
  % 'Alphabetische Bibliographie'
  % for all degree programmes in the natural sciences 
  % 
  % 'Numerische Bibliographie'
  % alternative for all other degree programmes
  % 
  % Either will load biblatex and setup the citation methods and the
  % bibliography styles correctly. You should not mess with them.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Styling the thesis
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Creating a visually pleasing layout and choosing fonts is not
% easy. Furthermore, different people have different preferences. Of
% course, for the University of Lübeck, the dean of studies could just
% force everyone to use one specific layout and font, but that seems a
% bit drastic and, also, it seems nice that thesis by different people
% have an individual style even though they all stick to the same
% overall structure.
%
% For these reasons, I (Till Tantau) have spend quite some time on
% designing a flexible layout and styling mechanism for theses.
%
% Basically, the overall structure of the thesis is fixed by the
% thesis class and so are many structural elements. For instance, you
% cannot change the order in which the abstract and table of contents
% are shown, you cannot move the bibliography elsewhere, indeed, the
% bibliography style is also fixed. Likewise, the text on the title
% page is fixed.
%
% Although many things are fixed, you *can* change several other
% things. For instance, you can change the font used for the main
% text, you can change which font is used for titles and headings or
% you can change whether titles and headlines are centered or flushed
% left.
%
% There are many LaTeX packages for changing such things. You are
% kindly asked *not to use them*. Rather, use (only) the options
% offered by the thesis class. All possible choices and combinations
% there have been tested by me and produce nice results; what happens
% with other packages no one knows and might no longer conform to what
% is expected by the university. As you will see, you still have a
% lot of options.
%
%
% Technical note: All styling is done via the command
%
% \UzLStyle{...}
%
% where ... is a key-value list just as for \UzLThesisSetup. The
% difference is just that everything having to do with styling as
% controlled by \UzLStyle, while the more “formal” setup keys are
% controlled by \UzLThesisSetup.
%
%%%
%
% Designs
%
%
% A \emph{design} is a whole set of font and layout options bundled
% together. They have been chosen in such a way that a visually
% pleasing “overall appearance” results.
%
%
% \UzLStyle{computer modern oldschool design}
%
% The look of this design mimics the “classical” way a paper or report
% created with \LaTeX\ looks like: The Computer Modern font is used,
% bold face fonts are used for headlines, only black and white are
% used as colors. This design reminds me of older scientific
% documents, especially from the computer science community where
% \LaTeX\ was used very early.
%
%
% \UzLStyle{computer modern basic design}
%
% A slightly less “oldschool” version of the previous design. It is
% still a classic design in the sense that it uses the Computer Modern
% font and that it still has this “good old \LaTeX” look, but some
% more modern aspects (like colors!) have been added.
%
% Note that this design uses Myriad for the title page (one of the
% “modern aspect”), which means that his font must be installed.
%
%
% \UzLStyle{computer modern scholary design}
%
% In my opinion, this is the ultimate “scholary design”: The thesis
% will look like it has been typeset by hand some 150 years ago and
% then printed by a university press. There is really nothing “modern”
% about it and the word in the name of the design is just part of the
% name of the “Computer Modern” font.
%
%
% \UzLStyle{pagella basic design}
%
% A, well, basic design that uses the Pagella font rather than the
% Computer Modern font. Especially the bold face version of this font
% looks nicer than the Computer Modern counterpart. Also, Pagella,
% while still having a “bookish” look, still feels a bit fresher than
% Computer Modern. 
%
%
% \UzLStyle{pagella centered design}
%
% A variant of the basic Pagella design that centers all
% headlines. A nice alternative to the basic version.
%
%
% \UzLStyle{pagella contrast design}
%
% This design tries to create some visual friction by contrasting the
% sans serif headline font (in bold!) with the main text. I find it a
% visually very interesting combination.
%
%
% \UzLStyle{alegrya basic design}
%
% The third variant of the basic design, this time using the Alegrya
% font. 
%
%
% \UzLStyle{alegrya scholary design}
%
% The Alegrya version of the previous “scholary” design. Unlike the
% Computer Modern version, this design does not look old, but more
% fresh -- while still creating the impression that the text must be
% about a very scientific subject. 
%
%
% \UzLStyle{alegrya stylish design}
%
% The design is quite similar to the scholary version for the Alegrya
% font, but with even more modern additions. “Stylish” is the word
% that comes to my mind.
%
%
\UzLStyle{alegrya modern design}
%
% A design that uses the sans serif version of the Alegrya font for
% the headlines. This is a nice modern overall design.

\section{T-Coffee}
T-Coffee (Tree-based Consistency Objective Function for Alignment Evaluation) is a multiple sequence alignment tool widely used in bioinformatics for aligning DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. T-Coffee works by employing an alignment strategy combined with a consistency-based scoring function. The algorithm for T-Coffee is primarily described in the original publication \citetitle{poirot_tcoffeeigs_2003} \cite{poirot_tcoffeeigs_2003}. The algorithm has the following main steps. T-Coffee first generates all possible pairwise alignments between the input sequences using global and local alignment methods. It then builds a primary library of alignment information from these pairwise alignments, assigning weights to each aligned residue pair based on their consistency across different alignments. The primary library is extended by incorporating transitive alignments, which helps in capturing indirect relationships between sequences. Using the extended library, T-Coffee constructs a guide tree and performs a progressive alignment, aligning the most similar sequences first and gradually adding more distant sequences. The initial alignment is iteratively refined to improve its overall quality and consistency.
T-Coffee is known for its high accuracy, especially when dealing with short sequences. It has been benchmarked against other alignment tools and has shown to produce alignments with accuracy comparable to or better than other methods like MUSCLE \cite{Edgar2004MUSCLEL}.

% Replace the following with your conclusion



% Normally, the bibliography comes next at this point. Do *not* (try
% to) include further indices and tables like an index or
% a list of figures or a list of tables or such things. Nobody
% actually uses them and they just use up space. 
%
% You *can* however include a glossary, if this seems appropriate. It
% goes here as an unnumbered chapter. Most thesis will *not* need a
% glossary: a well-written text (re)explains strange words and
% concepts as necessary. However, there are situations where a
% glossary may be helpful.














%%%
% 
% Bibliographies
%
%%%
%
% The uzl-thesis class will load biblatex for the bibliography
% management. This is a powerful package, see its documentation for
% details. The styles will be setup correctly and automatically by
% choosing one of the two style keys as described earlier.
%
% In order for the bibliography to work, run latex in the following
% order (which is the standard order):
% 
% > lualatex thesis-example
% > bibtex thesis-example
% > lualatex thesis-example
% 
% Add BibTeX files using \addbibresource or use the {bibtex entries}
% environment (see below).
%
%%%
%
% Although everyting is normally setup automatically, you can change
% the options passed to biblatex using the key 'biblatex';
% for instance,
%
%   \UzLThesisSetup{biblatex={firstinits=false}}
%
% will switch off shortened first names. Normally, you will not need
% this key in your preamble. 
% 
% Note that the bibtex program is used as the 'backend' of biblatex
% by default (rather than biber, which is the preferred program of
% biblatex). This means that you can (and must) run *bibtex* after you
% have run lualatex on your thesis. If you wish to use biber instead
% of bibtex, say 'biblatex={backend=biber}'. 
% 
%%%
%
% The following environment is optional. It allows you to keep the
% bibtex entries for your thesis right here in the thesis file. What
% happens is that each time this tex file is processed, the contents
% of the following environment gets written to the file
% \jobname-bibtex-entries.bib (this file gets overwritten each
% time). Independently, \addbibresource{\jobname-bibtex-entries.bib}
% is always called if the file \jobname-bibtex-entries.bib
% exists. 
%
% In result, you can edit and keep the bibliography's bibtex entries
% right here. If you change something here, run latex, then bibtex,
% then latex once more.
%
% If you would like to manage the bibtex entries in a separate file,
% remove the below environment, delete the \jobname-bibtex-entries.bib
% file and instead write
%
% \addbibresource{filename-of-your-bibtex-file.bib}
%
% in the preamble.
